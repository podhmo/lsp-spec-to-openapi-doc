        The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in the [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_intellisense) user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typically use case is for example: the 'textDocument/completion' request doesn't fill in the `documentation` property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a 'completionItem/resolve' request is sent with the selected completion item as a param. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in.

        >**Changed:** In 2.0 the request uses `TextDocumentPositionParams` with a proper `textDocument` and `position` property. In 1.0 the uri of the referenced text document was inlined into the params object.
